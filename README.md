# Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data
This jupyter notebook demonstrates how to make Figures 1 through 4 in my paper "Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data". Hopefully this will serve as a useful resource for those that are interested in CHIME/FRB flux calibration, and, more generally, those looking to use the [CHIME/FRB Open Beam Model](https://github.com/chime-frb-open-data/chime-frb-beam-model).
