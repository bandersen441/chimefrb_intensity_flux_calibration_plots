# Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data
This repository contains a jupyter notebook demonstrating how to make Figures 1 through 4 in my paper "Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data". Hopefully this will serve as a useful resource for those that are looking to use the [CHIME/FRB Open Beam Model](https://github.com/chime-frb-open-data/chime-frb-beam-model).
