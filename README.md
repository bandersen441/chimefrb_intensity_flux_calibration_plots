# Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data
This jupyter notebook demonstrates how to make Figures 1 through 4 in my paper "Flux Calibration of CHIME/FRB Intensity Data". Hopefully this will serve as a useful resource for those that are interested in CHIME/FRB flux calibration, and, more generally, those looking to use the [CHIME/FRB Open Beam Model](https://github.com/chime-frb-open-data/chime-frb-beam-model).

To view the notebook, you can just look at the `chimefrb_intensity_flux_calibration_plots.html` file. If you want to play with the notebook, clone the repository, install the requirements, then launch `jupyter`, like so:

    git clone git@github.com:bandersen441/chimefrb_intensity_flux_calibration_plots.git
    cd chimefrb_intensity_flux_calibration_plots
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    jupyter notebook

Cheers!
